<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">LEGEND OF THE LOST MINE</span></h2>
<p><i>Of the many romantic legends which abound throughout the West,
few match the Lost Mine story from which the peak takes its name. Is it
true? Did the mine exist? Or was it a campfire fabrication handed down
from generation to generation?</i></p>
<p class="tb">Early Spanish explorers of the Southwest, in their fervent search for
gold and other riches, discovered and developed many mines, some yielding
silver and gold. According to legend, a rich ore body was discovered
on the highest point of Lost Mine Peak. Life-term prisoners were forced
to work the mine. These men were blindfolded on several occasions in
their march from the Presidio in San Vicente, Mexico, to prevent them
from learning its location. The ruins of this presidio may still be observed
some 20 miles southwest of this peak across the Rio Grande in Mexico.</p>
<p>A story relates how the fierce Comanche Indians, who resented the
Spaniards&rsquo; invasion of their homeland and hunting grounds, attacked
and killed them to the last man. The last act, so goes the story, was to
seal the mine entrance to prevent further exploitation.</p>
<p>Legend states that if a person stands in the chapel door of San Vicente&rsquo;s
Mission on Easter morn, he can watch the sun&rsquo;s first rays strike Lost Mine
Peak at the exact mine entrance.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">LOST MINE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>This is your guidebook for using the trail which starts at this registration
desk. For about one mile of this walk the interesting plants, unusual
geological features and other things of interest are explained. <i><b>Each
object of special interest is marked by a numbered stake.</b></i> Refer to the
corresponding number in this booklet, and you will find the name of the
plant or feature and a description. The information recorded here is
necessarily brief, but the rangers will be glad to answer your questions and
give additional information.</p>
<p class="tb">1. <span class="sc">Evergreen Sumac</span> (<i>Rhus virens</i>). This sumac is commonly found
in Green Gulch and through the Chisos Mountains. It bears attractive
clusters of small white flowers followed by red berries which are seen in
the late autumn and winter.</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Alligator Juniper</span> (<i>Juniperus deppeana</i>). Observe alligator skin-like
bark of the tree which easily identifies this evergreen and gives it its
name. Under favorable conditions the species attains an age in excess
of 500 years.</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">Mexican Pinyon</span> (<i>Pinus cembroides</i>), is the only species of pine
found along this trail. Pinyon is the name given by the early Spanish
explorers and was described by Cabeza de Vaca in 1536. The seeds are
used by Indians for food and in recent years the nuts of a close relative,
<i>Pinus edulis</i>, have become an article of commerce.</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">Gray Oak</span> (<i>Quercus grisea</i>). There are several species of oak on
this trail, but this particular one is easily recognized by the blue-gray
color of its leaves.</p>
<p>5. <span class="sc">Emory Oak</span> (<i>Quercus emoryi</i>). Of the several oaks in the park, this
represents one of the larger evergreen groups. The acorns are edible,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
sweet, and are important as food for birds and small mammals. Notice
the glossy hollylike leaves.</p>
<p>6. <span class="sc">Graves Oak</span> (<i>Quercus gravesi</i>). Here is another of the oaks with
typical notched or toothed leaf margins. The lovely fall colors of the
Chisos Mountains (pronounced <span class="smaller">CHEE</span>-sose) are principally due to the
abundance of these trees whose leaves takes on the rusts and reds of
autumn.</p>
<p>7. <span class="sc">Picture!</span> From this point on the trail there is an excellent view of
Green Gulch. The high point on the left (north) of the gulch is Pulliam
Peak, 6,921 feet high. The faraway hills are the Rosillos Mountains, so
named because of their roan coloring.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Agave</i></p>
</div>
<p>8. <span class="sc">Agave</span> (<i>Agave scabra</i>). There
are many different species of
agaves (often called century
plants) in the Southwest, several
occurring in Big Bend. Plants of
this group furnish many important
products in Mexico, and were
utilized by Indians in various
ways. Among the products are
fiber, food, drink (mescal), soap
and medicine. Agaves are grown
commercially in more than 40
countries. These plants store up
food in the root and leaf systems
for many years, finally send up
one fast-growing flower stalk, mature
their seeds, and then die.
The bloom stalk grows almost 10
inches a day and represents the
largest bloom of any North American
plant.</p>
<p>9. <span class="sc">Texas Madrone</span> (<i>Arbutus
texana</i>). This beautiful tree has
thin, peeling bark. Its red berries,
which mature in November, are highly favored by deer which often rise
up on their hind legs to reach them. The name &ldquo;Naked Indian&rdquo; is sometimes
applied because the twigs and branches are the copper color of the
Indian torso. A close relative of this madrone is found along the west
coast. Most of the madrones along this trail were killed by drouth. This
one is sprouting from the old base. There are a number of fine living
madrones along the road in upper Green Gulch.</p>
<p>A fine angle view of Casa Grande is obtainable here. This large single
mass of volcanic rock (rhyolite) is 7,300 feet high.</p>
<p>10. <span class="sc">Skunkbush Sumac</span>, or <span class="sc">Squawbush</span> (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>). Although
this sumac belongs to the same family as the obnoxious poison ivy, it
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
has none of the latter&rsquo;s irritating qualities. Leaves turn brilliant shades
of red and orange in the autumn.</p>
<p>11. <span class="sc">Basketgrass</span> (<i>Nolina erumpens</i>). Although referred to as a grass,
this plant belong to the lily family. The narrow, fibrous grasslike leaves
often attain a length of 5 feet, making them excellent material for native
basketry. The compact clusters of small pinkish-white flowers rarely rise
above the rank mass of foliage.</p>
<p>12. <span class="sc">Geological Explanation.</span>
This rock is called conglomerate,
because it is formed from many
kinds of rocks from many places.
Note the rounded shapes of the
individual stones, caused by wearing
away of the sharp corners and
edges when they were being transported
by streams millions of years
ago. Later these materials were
deposited in beds and under the
terrific pressure of overlying
masses of sediments were compacted
with mineral cementing
materials to form the solid mass
which you see here.</p>
<p>13. <span class="sc">Drooping Juniper</span> (<i>Juniperus
flaccida</i>). Appearing to be
slightly wilted, the drooping aspects
of this graceful evergreen
suggests grief. Botanists claim that
Big Bend National Park is the only area in the United States in which
it is found.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap"><i>Drooping Juniper</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CACTUS GARDEN</span></h2>
<p>14. <span class="sc">Lechuguilla</span> (<i>Agave lechuguilla</i>) (pronounced lay-choo-<span class="smaller">GHEE</span>-yuh)
is a small species of agave whose leaf crown somewhat resembles a bunch
of green bananas, and does not belong to the cactus family. The plant
is so well protected by its spine-tipped leaves that even hungry goats
refrain from eating it. The fibers within the fleshy leaves are used extensively
in northern Mexico for making brushes, matting, coarse twine
and rope. The short stem is used as a substitute for soap.</p>
<p>15. <span class="sc">Claretcup Echinocereus</span> (<i>Echinocereus triglochidiatus</i>). This is
one of the commonest and most spectacular of our hedgehog cactuses.
Occasionally, plants will have as many as 50 salmon-colored blossoms
open at the same time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="548" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Desert vegetation and Chisos Mountains as seen from the east.</i></p>
</div>
<p>16. <span class="sc">Engelmann Pricklypear</span> (<i>Opuntia engelmanni</i>) is one of the
desert&rsquo;s most useful plants. Its fruits may be eaten raw and delicious
jams and jellies may be made from them. When young and tender, the
young joints are called &ldquo;nopalitas&rdquo; (no-pahl-<span class="smaller">EE</span>-tahs), and are cooked
and eaten. Ranchmen burn off the spines to supply hungry cattle with
food when the range is poor. In the lower elevations of the park a lovely
purple-colored species is found, known as purple-tinge cactus.</p>
<p>17. <span class="sc">Strawberry Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus stramineus</i>) has one of the
desert&rsquo;s tastiest fruits. When ripe, the fruit resembles a strawberry in
texture and is delicious served with cream. The blossom is a deep red
and is one of the park&rsquo;s gems of floral beauty. Large numbers of these
dome-shaped plant mounds may be observed along the highways throughout
the park.</p>
<p>18. <span class="sc">Brownpitaya</span> (<i>Echinocereus chloranthus</i>) is one of the so-called
rainbow cactus group. Notice the banded color separation of the short
needles. The small brown flowers grow around the plant in large numbers
during the bloom period. Another variety, which grows at low elevations
in the park, has yellow-orange blossoms reaching a diameter of 4 inches.</p>
<p>19. <span class="sc">Mountain-Mahogany</span> (<i>Cercocarpus eximius</i>). The wood is extremely
hard, so brittle that it may be broken very easily. Deer browse
on the leaves, and, outside the park, cattle and sheep feed upon it.</p>
<p>20. <span class="sc">Lichen.</span> Raise your eyes to the exposed barren escarpments of
Casa Grande and other rock outcroppings. Here you observe greens,
blacks, and other colors. Much of this color may be attributed to the
lichens (<span class="smaller">LYK</span>-ehnz) encrusting the bare rock surfaces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The small colorful organisms are the first visible signs of life to gain
a foothold on rocks. Without true roots, this little &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; obtains
moisture from the atmosphere. A lichen is actually a fungus and an alga
living together in mutual dependence (one provides board and the other
room for both). As a product of their life processes, carbonic acid is
formed. This slowly disintegrates the rock, helping to form soil, thus
aiding in the production of suitable living conditions for higher types of
plants.</p>
<p>21. <span class="sc">Ash</span> (<i>Fraxinus</i> sp.). Ash has long been identified as a very useful
wood; even the early Indians utilized it for paddles, bows, arrows, etc.
The winged seed resembles a small canoe paddle.</p>
<p>22. <span class="sc">One-Seed Juniper</span> (<i>Juniperus monosperma</i>). There are four junipers
found in the park. (You have already seen two of the others along
this trail.) This one is so named because it has but one seed in each
berry. Junipers (often miscalled cedars) are distinguished from other
cone-bearers by the seeds being enclosed in a berry instead of a cone.
The wood is resistant to decay and used much for posts. Of course, in
a National Park, trees are preserved for their scenic and watershed protection
value and are not harvested for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>23. <span class="sc">Another picture just ahead</span>&mdash;Striking view of Juniper Canyon.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><b><i>Help Protect the Park from FIRE
<br />Please Smoke Only in Designated Areas</i></b></p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">ORIENTATION POINT</span></h2>
<p>As an inducement for hikers desiring to continue farther along this
trail, an orientation table has been constructed about 1&frac12; miles beyond
this point. The table points out the major landscape features together
with their elevations. From the same general area, a spectacular view
of the rugged Big Bend country may be enjoyed.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">GEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE</span></h2>
<p>Millions of years ago, the ocean which extended from the Gulf of
Mexico to the Arctic Circle covered this part of west Texas. Muds, sands,
and gravels were deposited in the bottom of that ocean. In these sands
and gravels were preserved the remains of fish, shellfish, and various
other forms of sea life.</p>
<p>Tremendous pressures within the globe&rsquo;s interior caused the earth&rsquo;s
surface to rise in this region and the waters to recede. Much of the area
became swampy, forming suitable habitat for the giant dinosaurs. Peat
beds were compressed to form coal deposits. The remains of these coal
beds as well as of petrified trees and dinosaur bones may be seen in the
rock exposed in various parts of the park. At a still later date there were
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
more extensive earth movements which caused great breaks to occur in
the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="528" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sierra del Carmen in Mexico</i></p>
</div>
<p>Generally speaking, the geologic structure in the Big Bend area is
a &ldquo;sunken block&rdquo; that might be compared to cutting through the elevated
landscape twice. One cut is along the Sierra del Carmen mountains
on the east, and the other at Santa Elena Canyon on the west. The area
between the two cuts has sunk an average of several thousand feet. The
central part of this block has been arched upward forming the Mariscal,
Chisos, and Christmas Mountains.</p>
<p>Part of this uplift was caused by volcanic activity. Large masses of
molten rock pushed toward the earth&rsquo;s surface and arched and deformed
the overlying sedimentary layers that had long before been deposited on
the floor of the ocean. The Chisos Mountains were formed by this volcanic
pressure.</p>
<p>As you look south or north, you see an extensive plain that is underlain
very largely by sedimentary rock layers. The isolated peaks for the most
part were caused by hot lava that pushed up from below, then cooled
to make the present highlands. This is also true of the Chisos Mountains
which are a much larger mass. Cooling of these melted rocks caused
fracture joints, or shrinkage cracks, and weathering along these breaks
caused the columns, spires, buttresses, and pinnacles that you see in all
directions near you. Forces of erosion have done most of the carving,
forming the various rugged features near at hand.</p>
<p>The geological history is very complex and cannot be even summarized
in a few paragraphs. Park Rangers can give you additional information
regarding the geological history, or explain the origin of features you
may wish to know more about.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
